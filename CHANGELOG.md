# Changelog

## 0.1.1 - 2026-05-26

### Added

- Added robust Qt runtime plugin path configuration at startup to reduce platform plugin lookup failures in packaged builds.
- Added support in `packaging/build.ps1` for using `.venv313` in onefile builds (`-UsePy313`), with automatic preference for `.venv313` when available.
- Added structured Nuitka build reporting to `%LOCALAPPDATA%/fs25-profile-switcher/build-logs`.

### Changed

- Updated onefile build strategy to use `--onefile-no-compression` for improved stability on the current toolchain.
- Updated packaging version metadata in `packaging/build.ps1` to `0.1.1`.
- Updated documentation to reflect the recommended stable build flow (`.venv313`) and external build log location.

### Fixed

- Fixed onefile packaging reliability issues observed with the previous setup.
- Improved handling of missing `config.yaml` by searching multiple locations and providing clearer diagnostics.

### Build / Release

- Project version bumped from `0.1.0` to `0.1.1` in `pyproject.toml`.
- Expanded `.gitignore` for local build artifacts and environments:
  - `dist_*/`
  - `.venv313/`
  - existing Nuitka local log patterns retained.
